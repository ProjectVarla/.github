# Project Varla

## What is Varla?
Varla is [`@MohammadRimawi`](https://github.com/MohammadRimawi)'s virtual assistant, she is being built in microservice architecture using Python, FastAPI, Typer, MySQL, Flutter, and more..., and is completely open source.

## Why am I building Varla?
- To remove the overhead of managing a lot of services as they keep on growing
- To be able to add any feature I want to my daily life easily.
- Accessible from Command Line on any computer I use with simple steps and from my phone through a mobile app.
- To learn some programming aspects I can't find in small projects such as:
  - [ ] Sockets/Websockets.
  - [ ] Unit/Integration testing.
  - [ ] Git branches and using git professionally in general.
  - [ ] Managing multiple repos.
  - [ ] Dependency Injection.
  - [ ] Application Security and Encryption.
  - [ ] Scheduling.
  - [ ] Home Automation using Raspberry Pi Peco w.
  - [ ] Sufficient mobile development.
  - [ ] Multi-Threading.
  - [ ] Text to Speech.
  - [ ] Speech to Text.
  - [ ] Machine Learning (Maybe yes maybe no :P)
  - [ ] Technical terminology. 
  - [ ] Proper documentation.
  - [ ] Using issues and tickets to organize development.
